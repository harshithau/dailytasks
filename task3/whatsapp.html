				WhatsApp Messenger from Facebook is a freeware, cross-platform messaging and Voice over IP (VoIP) service owned by Facebook.[41] It allows users to send text messages and voice messages,[42] make voice and video calls, and share images, documents, user locations, and other media.[43][44] WhatsApp's client application runs on mobile devices but is also accessible from desktop computers, as long as the user's mobile device remains connected to the Internet while they use the desktop app.[45] The service requires users to provide a standard cellular mobile number for registering with the service.[46] In January 2018, WhatsApp released a standalone business app targeted at small business owners, called WhatsApp Business, to allow companies to communicate with customers who use the standard WhatsApp client.[47][48]

				The client application was created by WhatsApp Inc. of Mountain View, California, which was acquired by 	Facebook in February 2014 for approximately US$ 19.3 billion.[49][50] By February 2018, WhatsApp had over one and a half billion users,[51][52] making it the world's most popular messaging application at the time.[52][53] It has become the primary means of communication in multiple countries, including Brazil, India, Pakistan and large parts of Europe, including the United Kingdom and France.[52]
