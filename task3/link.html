<h2><a name="nesting">Tables, forms, and nesting them</a></h2>

<P>Tables and forms are separate concepts in HTML. People sometimes
confuse them with each other. The conceptual confusion is often
accompanied with confused <em>markup</em>.
On the other hand, tables and forms <em>can</em> be "mixed" in a sense.
Specifically, you can put a table inside a form or vice versa,
and it is often useful to do so. But you need to understand
what you are doing.
</P><P>
Tables and forms can be nested either way. But if you put
<STRONG>forms into tables</STRONG>,
<em>each</em> form must be completely included into a single table
cell (one <code>TD</code> element in practice).
Thereby the forms are each <em>completely independent</em>.
See my <a href="choices.html">document on choices in HTML forms</a>
for some simple examples.</P>
<P>
What people probably want to do more often is to nest
them the other way: a <code>TABLE</code> element
inside a <code>FORM</code> element. Then all
form fields within the table cells, being in <code>TR</code>
elements within the
<code>TABLE</code> element which is within the
<code>FORM</code> element, are fields of the <em>same</em>
form.
</P>
<h2><a name="why"><em>Should</em> tables be used to structurize forms?</a></h2>
<P>
Whether it is useful to
put the fields of a form into a table (within the <code>FORM</code>
element)
really depends on the form. For some odd reason,
people who design HTML forms are often stuck with ideas of how
forms are designed for
<em>paper</em>. They put several unrelated questions
to one row as if it were important to save paper. As a result,
forms become harder to fill, since the intended
<em>order</em> of filling it
is not obvious. Rowwise or columnwise? Users may even fail to notice
some questions. And having created a confused order, authors start
wondering how to define
<a href="tabbing.html">tabbing order</a> and things like that.
</P><P>
It is best to organize forms simply: don't use tables to force
some particular <em>layout</em> but to indicate the <em>structure</em>
when needed. Browsers are expected to present tables, and HTML documents
in general, in a manner which corresponds to
the structure expressed in HTML.
</P>
<P>To take a fairly common example: Assume that you wish to let the
user pick up a product from a list in and order form. Probably the
product information consists of some fields like product name,
order number, and unit price for each product. This means that the
data itself is inherently tabular. Why not make it table?
That would make the appearance reflect the structure.
There are some technicalities involved here; see
<a href="choices.html#tabopt">notes on using checkboxes or radio
buttons</a> (instead of <code>SELECT</code>) for such purposes.</p>


<h2><a name="example">An example</a></h2>

<P>
As a <strong>simple example</strong>, consider the situation where
some text (field
label or something like that) is associated with an input field.
(There are better ways for doing that in principle in
<a href="../html4.html"
title="A quick index to the HTML 4.0 specification"
>HTML 4.0</a>,
but currently the table idea might be better.) 
You could set up a table where the first column contains the
texts and the second column contains the corresponding
input fields:
<PRE><CODE>&lt;FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="http://jkorpela.fi/cgi-bin/echo.cgi"&gt;
&lt;TABLE BORDER="1"&gt;
  &lt;TR&gt;
    &lt;TD&gt;Your name&lt;/TD&gt;
    &lt;TD&gt;
      &lt;INPUT TYPE="TEXT" NAME="name" SIZE="20"&gt;
    &lt;/TD&gt;
  &lt;/TR&gt;
  &lt;TR&gt;
    &lt;TD&gt;Your E-mail address&lt;/TD&gt;
    &lt;TD&gt;&lt;INPUT TYPE="TEXT" NAME="email" SIZE="25"&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
  &lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;INPUT TYPE="SUBMIT" VALUE="Submit" NAME="B1"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;/FORM&gt;</CODE></PRE>
<P><strong>On your current browser</strong> with its current settings,
this would appear as follows:
<FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="http://jkorpela.fi/cgi-bin/echo.cgi">
<TABLE BORDER="1">
  <TR>
    <TD>Your name</TD>
    <TD>
      <INPUT TYPE="TEXT" NAME="name" SIZE="20">
    </TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Your E-mail address</TD>
    <TD><INPUT TYPE="TEXT" NAME="email" SIZE="25"></TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>
<P><INPUT TYPE="SUBMIT" VALUE="Submit" NAME="B1"></P>
</FORM>

<p><small class="deem">The presentation can be affected by
style sheets. In particular, this document comes with
<a href="../basic.css">a style sheet</a>
which makes some presentational suggestions, so presentation
may differ from your browser's <em>usual</em> way of displaying
forms. See the document <cite><a href=
"present.html">Affecting the presentation of form fields on
Web pages</a></cite>.</small></p> 

<p>Another typical case for using a table is to
organize a <strong>set of radio buttons</strong>.
There is <a href="choices.html#assoc">an example</a> of this
in
<a href="choices.html"><cite>Choices
in HTML forms</cite></a> as well as
<a href="#fieldset-table">at the end of the current document</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="notes">Notes</a></h2>

<h3><a name="large">Avoid too large tables</a></h3>

<P>Although this method can be used for a form with a large number
of fields, a practical
<em class="warning">word of warning</em> is in order: the larger a table
is, the longer it takes from a browser to display it. (The browser has
to process the entire table before displaying anything of it, since
it must take all cells into account when selecting suitable column
widths.) Perhaps you can divide the content of a form into major
sections, with headings, and structurize each section separately as
a small table.</P>

<!--

<h3><a name="align">Avoid <code>table align="left"</code>
(or <code>"right"</code>)</a></h3>

<p>Due to
<a href="tabbug.html" title=
"Description of a Netscape bug: table align=left confuses tabbing order"
>a Netscape bug</a>, it is best to avoid using
the <code>align="left"</code> attribute for a table containing
form fields. The reason is that Netscape seems to skip forms fields
inside such tables in the tabbing order!
(<dfn><a href="tabbing.html">Tabbing order</a></dfn>
is the order in which a browser traverses form fields and links
on a page when the user presses the TAB key. It is an important
useability and accessibility factor.)</p>

<p>Using <code>table align="right"</code> has similar effect.</p>
<p><small>With <code>align="center"</code> the situation seems to be different,
but such attributes, as well as
<code>&lt;center&gt;</code>
markup, have varying effects on different browsers. The effects may even
depend on the <code>DOCTYPE</code> declaration!
Since centering tables properly using a style sheet does not work well
on current browsers, it's perhaps best to avoid attempts to center tables.
Maybe it is sufficient to suggest just some reasonable left margin,
using a style sheet.</small></p>
-->


<h3><a name="button">Positioning the submit button</a></h3>
<P>
Notice that in our <a href="#example">example</a>
the <strong>submit button</strong> is outside the table.
The reason is that it has a different role than the other fields.
It <em>could</em> be within the table too, but perhaps it is
easier to find if it isn't. 
</p><p>
Also notice that
contrary to popular
belief among authors, a
<a href="imagereset.html#need"><strong>reset
button</strong></a> is not obligatory or even
useful, as a rule. It is especially dangerous when presented
alongside with a submit button!
</P>
<h3><a name="th">Using table header cells</a></h3>
<p>
Our example uses the <code>TD</code> (table data cell) element
markup for all cells, both those containing form fields and those
containing titles for fields. It might be more logical
to regard the latter as <strong>headings</strong> and use the
<code>TH</code> (table heading cell) markup. For example:
</p>
<PRE><CODE>  &lt;TR&gt;
    &lt;TH&gt;Your name&lt;/TH&gt;
    &lt;TD&gt;
      &lt;INPUT TYPE="TEXT" NAME="name" SIZE="20"&gt;
    &lt;/TD&gt;
  &lt;/TR&gt;</CODE></PRE>

<p>A typical presentation of <code>TH</code> elements uses
more <em>emphatic</em> style than for <code>TD</code> cells,
e.g. by using <strong>bold face</strong>.
Moreover, by default the content of a heading cell is
<em>centered</em> whereas normal cells are left-aligned;
this can be affected by using the <code>ALIGN</code> attribute
if desired.
The following shows
how <em>your</em> browser displays (perhaps affected by a style
sheet suggested in this document)
our sample form when <code>TH</code>
markup is used for the texts which are logically field titles: 
<FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="http://jkorpela.fi/cgi-bin/echo.cgi">
<TABLE BORDER="1">
  <TR>
    <TH>Your name</TH>
    <TD>
      <INPUT TYPE="TEXT" NAME="name" SIZE="20">
    </TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TH>Your E-mail address</TH>
    <TD><INPUT TYPE="TEXT" NAME="email" SIZE="25"></TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>
<P><INPUT TYPE="SUBMIT" VALUE="Submit" NAME="B1"></P>
</FORM>

<h3><a name="present">Tuning the visual appearance</a></h3>

<p>When tables and forms are nested (either way), there is
an especially large number of factors that affect the way the
page looks like, such as
<ul>
  <li> differences between browsers and browser settings
  <li> basic HTML markup, such as <a href="#th"><code>th</code>
       vs. <code>td</code></a> (see above) 
  <li> attributes in table-related tags, such as
       <code>cellpadding</code> and <code>cellspacing</code>
       in a <code>table</code> tag and <code>align</code> and
       <code>valign</code> attributes in <code>td</code> and <code>th</code>
       tags
  <li> attributes in form markup (e.g. the <code>size</code> attribute
       in <code>input</code> tags; note that the
<a href="present.html#inputwidth">width of an input box
       is <em>also</em> affected by the font in use</a>, perhaps in
       a surprising way)
  <li> style sheets, which can be used in quite a few ways, but often
       with unwanted effects too, due to browser bugs.
</ul>

<p>The document <cite><a href=
"present.html">Affecting the presentation of form fields on
Web pages</a></cite> discusses the form-related issues in some details.

<table align="right" border="2"><tr><td bgcolor="#cccccc"><form
action="http://jkorpela.fi/cgi-bin/echo.cgi">
<input type="submit" name="submitname" value="Demo">
</form></td></tr>
</table>
<p><a name="restr">As regards to issues specific to the <em>combination</em></a>
of tables and forms, note that if you put a form into a table cell,
then you there might be some unwanted
<strong>extra vertical space</strong> below
the form. There are various
<a href="extraspace.html">ways to try to suppress that</a>.
<strong>If there is only one form</strong> in the table, one of the ways is to
<a href="#nesting">change the structure</a>
so that the form and the table are nested the other way around:
the form contains the table, even though only one cell contains
fields of the form.
Technically you'd just move the start and end tags of the form.
This means something like the following
(in a case where the form appears in the last cell of the table):</p>

<table border="1">
<tr><th>Unmodified markup</th> <th>Modified markup</th></tr>
<tr>
<td><pre>&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;...&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;...&lt;/tr&gt;
...
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;...
 &lt;td&gt;
 <strong>&lt;form action="..."&gt;</strong>
  &lt;input ...&gt;
  &lt;input ...&gt;
  ...
 <strong>&lt;/form&gt;</strong>
 &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;</pre></td>
<td><pre><strong>&lt;form action="..."&gt;</strong>
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;...&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;...&lt;/tr&gt;
...
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;...
 &lt;td&gt;
  &lt;input ...&gt;
  &lt;input ...&gt;
  ...
 &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
<strong>&lt;/form&gt;</strong></pre></td></tr>
</table>

<p>The modified markup may look illogical, since structurally
there is no need to have all the stuff in the other cells inside
the form. But
it can be done in valid HTML and with well-defined meaning: 
when the form is submitted, only the form fields matter,
so the other content in the form has no effect on how form submission works.
And since the (probable) extra spacing after a form appears only after the
entire table, the presentational problem is removed, or at least made
less important.</p>

<p>There are, however, the following problems with this approach,
where the <code>form</code> element contains much more than
what logically constitutes a form: A visual browser might have
(e.g., due to a user style sheet) a special presentation for a form
as a whole, e.g. using a distinctive background color or image to
make the structure clear. When the markup is illogical, the user
will be confused. Similarly, a speech-based user agent probably
indicates the start of a form by saying, for example,
"start of form 1". This is confusing, if the actual start of the
form is far ahead.</p>

<h2><a name="br">An alternative: using just line breaks</a></h2>
<P>
Of course, you could <strong>dispense with tables</strong> within forms.
You could simply write e.g.
<PRE><CODE>&lt;FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="http://jkorpela.fi/cgi-bin/echo.cgi"&gt;
Your name: &lt;INPUT TYPE="TEXT" NAME="name" SIZE="20"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Your E-mail address:
&lt;INPUT TYPE="TEXT" NAME="email" SIZE="25"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;INPUT TYPE="SUBMIT" VALUE="Submit" NAME="B1"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;/FORM&gt;</CODE></PRE>
<P><em>On your current browser</em> with its current settings,
this would appear as follows:
<FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="http://jkorpela.fi/cgi-bin/echo.cgi">
Your name: <INPUT TYPE="TEXT" NAME="name" SIZE="20">
<BR>
Your E-mail address:
<INPUT TYPE="TEXT" NAME="email" SIZE="25"><br>
<INPUT TYPE="SUBMIT" VALUE="Submit" NAME="B1">
</FORM>

<P>The <code>BR</code> elements cause line breaks.
It is largely a matter of taste whether you prefer this style to
using tables. The main difference in typical presentation is that
when using a table, the input fields "line up" forming a column.
And style sheets or presentational attributes in table-related elements
could be used to suggest the details of the presentation.
</P>

<h2><a name="p">Another alternative: using paragraphs</a></h2>

<p>You could also make each pair of field title and
field element into a separate paragraph, a <code>P</code> element, e.g.
</p>
<PRE><CODE>&lt;FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="http://jkorpela.fi/cgi-bin/echo.cgi"&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
Your name: &lt;INPUT TYPE="TEXT" NAME="name" SIZE="20"&gt;
&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
Your E-mail address:
&lt;INPUT TYPE="TEXT" NAME="email" SIZE="25"&gt;
&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;INPUT TYPE="SUBMIT" VALUE="Submit" NAME="B1"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;/FORM&gt;</CODE></PRE>
<P><em>On your current browser</em> with its current settings,
this would appear as follows:
<FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="http://jkorpela.fi/cgi-bin/echo.cgi">
<P>
Your name: <INPUT TYPE="TEXT" NAME="name" SIZE="20">
</P><P>
Your E-mail address:
<INPUT TYPE="TEXT" NAME="email" SIZE="25">
</P>
<P><INPUT TYPE="SUBMIT" VALUE="Submit" NAME="B1"></P>
</FORM>
<p>Although some people might say this would be waste of
space, the use of some empty vertical space (as caused
by browsers' way of presenting paragraphs) isn't really wasteful.
</P>
<p>But since it might be argued that a field name and a field
do not constitute a paragraph, you could alternatively use
<code>DIV</code> elements instead of <code>P</code>&nbsp;elements.
This would introduce no extra vertical spacing.</p>

<h2><a name="fieldset">Yet another alternative: <code>FIELDSET</code></a></h2>

<p>One way of structuring a form
is the
<a title="Description of FIELDSET in WDG's HTML 4.0 reference"
href="http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/html40/forms/fieldset.html">
<code>FIELDSET</code> element</a>.

<PRE><CODE CLASS="html">&lt;form method="post" action="http://jkorpela.fi/cgi-bin/echo.cgi"&gt;
&lt;fieldset&gt;
  &lt;legend&gt;Your name&lt;/legend&gt;
  &lt;input type="text" name="name" size="20"&gt;
&lt;/fieldset&gt;
&lt;fieldset&gt;
  &lt;legend&gt;Your E-mail address&lt;/legend&gt;
  &lt;input type="text" name="email" size="25"&gt;
&lt;/fieldset&gt;
&lt;input type="submit" value="submit" name="b1"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</CODE></PRE>

<p>The following shows the presentation of the form on your current
browser (on the left) and on IE 4 (on the right):</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td valign="middle">
<form method="post" action="http://jkorpela.fi/cgi-bin/echo.cgi">
<div></div>
<fieldset>
  <legend>Your name</legend><p>
  <input type="text" name="name" size="20">

<fieldset>
  <legend>Your E-mail address</legend><p>
  <input type="text" name="email" size="25">

<p><input type="submit" value="submit" name="b1"></P>
</form>
</td>
<td valign="middle">

title="IE 4.0 screen shot"
alt=
"[A presentation where the input fields appear in boxes of a special kind with the legends as headings over the top borders of the boxes.]"
>
</td>
</table>

<p><a name="fieldset-table">It is also possible to
<strong>combine the use of <code>FIELDSET</code>
with the use of a table</strong> to structurize e.g. a set of radio buttons.</a>
For radio buttons, and for checkboxes, the conventional method is to
put the associated text after the radio button or checkbox. This
is somewhat illogical but so common that accessibility tools might
handle it better than the logical order.
Example:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;FIELDSET&gt;&lt;LEGEND&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/LEGEND&gt;
&lt;TABLE BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="5"&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;
&lt;LABEL&gt;&lt;INPUT TYPE="RADIO" NAME="gender" CHECKED
VALUE="Unspecified"&gt;Unspecified
&lt;/LABEL&gt;&lt;TD&gt;
&lt;LABEL&gt;&lt;INPUT TYPE="RADIO" NAME="gender"
VALUE="Female"&gt;Female&lt;/LABEL&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;
&lt;LABEL&gt;&lt;INPUT TYPE="RADIO" NAME="gender" VALUE="Male"&gt;Male&lt;/LABEL&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;
&lt;/FIELDSET&gt;</code></pre>

<p>This results in the following presentation on your current browser:
<FORM ACTION="http://jkorpela.fi/cgi-bin/echo.cgi"
METHOD="POST">
<FIELDSET><LEGEND><strong>Gender</strong></LEGEND>
<TABLE BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="5">
<TR><TD>
<LABEL><INPUT TYPE="RADIO" NAME="gender" CHECKED
VALUE="Unspecified">Unspecified</LABEL>
<TD>
<LABEL><INPUT TYPE="RADIO" NAME="gender"
VALUE="Female">Female</LABEL>
<TD>
<LABEL><INPUT TYPE="RADIO" NAME="gender" VALUE="Male">Male</LABEL>
</TABLE>
</FIELDSET>
</FORM>

<p>
It would perhaps be better (in cases like this at least, when there is
a small number of alternatives) if the
legend
(which is logically a heading for the set of radio buttons)
appeared at the same line as the alternatives. But the syntax of
<code>FIELDSET</code> makes this impossible: the first element there must
be <code>LEGEND</code>, so one cannot organize the legend and the buttons with
their labels as one row in a table.</p>

<p>For accessibility reasons, and for clarity, it would be better to
make each alternative appear on a line (row) of its own, using the
same approach as above but a one-column table instead of a one-row
table. Example:</p> 

<FORM ACTION="http://jkorpela.fi/cgi-bin/echo.cgi"
METHOD="POST">
<p>
<FIELDSET><LEGEND><strong>Gender</strong></LEGEND>
<TABLE BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="5">
<TR><TD>
<LABEL><INPUT TYPE="RADIO" NAME="gender" CHECKED
VALUE="Unspecified">Unspecified</LABEL>
<tr><TD>
<LABEL><INPUT TYPE="RADIO" NAME="gender"
VALUE="Female">Female</LABEL>
<tr><TD>
<LABEL><INPUT TYPE="RADIO" NAME="gender" VALUE="Male">Male</LABEL>
</TABLE>
</FIELDSET>
</FORM>

<p>In this approach, on the other hand, the table markup is rather
unnecessary. You could just wrap each <code>LABEL</code> element
inside a <code>DIV</code> element.</p>

<h2><a name="css">Using CSS to create tabular look</a></h2>

<p>I have often argued that such a construct is a structural table (tabular data), not a layout table. It expresses the two-dimensional structure of the data in the form, including input fields. But many people disagree.
Anyway, let's consider how you could achieve tabular layout for
a form without using a table.</p>

<p>There are different approaches, but a simple one is like this:
In HTML, inside a <code>form</code> element, use
something like

<pre>
&lt;div&gt;&lt;label for="a"&gt;a&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input id="a" name="x"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;label for="b"&gt;abracadabra&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input id="b" name="y"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
<i>etc.</i>
</pre>

<p>This works without CSS, though not with a nice layout. For the layout, you could use CSS to suggest a common width for the <code>label</code> elements. This is guesswork to some extent, since you'd like to have width that is sufficient for all labels, but not wider than needed. Example:</p>

<pre>
label { display: block; width: 6em; float: left; }
</pre>

<p>This is how it looks like on your browser:</p>
<FORM ACTION="http://jkorpela.fi/cgi-bin/echo.cgi"
METHOD="POST" class="tabular">
<div><label for="a">a</label><input id="a" name="x"></div>
