				An interactive software application developed to utilize the core technologies of the Facebook platform to create an extensive social media framework for the app.  Facebook Apps integrate Facebook's News Feed, Notifications, various social channels and other features to generate awareness and interest in the app by Facebook users.

				While it hasn't been possible to exchange real currency directly within Facebook Apps and Facebook Games, apps can utilize Facebook's Facebook Credits, a virtual currency that can be purchased (with actual money) in order to acquire virtual goods and services within Facebook apps and games.
