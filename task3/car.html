								Maruti Suzuki Swift Out of the different types of cars, a sedan (US) or a saloon (UK) is traditionally defined as a car with four doors and a typical boot/ trunk. A slightly technical detail is that it usually features a 3-box configuration with each of the boxes categorically used for the engine, passenger, and cargo. Sedans have several sub-types such as notchback, fastback, compact, and sub-compact. It may be interesting to note that cars such as the older generation models of the Skoda Octavia are often incorrectly referred to as notchbacks. Examples of sedans: Maruti Suzuki Ciaz, Hyundai Elantra, etc.
