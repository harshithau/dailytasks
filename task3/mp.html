				A multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) or multi-utility vehicle (MUV) are commonly known as 'people carriers'. They are designed to offer enhanced space and comfort for passengers with two or three rows of seating and large doors. The third row on MPVs/ MUVs can generally be reconfigured.

Examples of MPVs: Maruti Suzuki Omni, Maruti Suzuki Eeco, Datsun GO+, etc.
